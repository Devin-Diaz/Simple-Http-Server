HTTP Server: Plain old computer that needs to be connected to a network.

That server then listens for requests from clients and responds to them.
For encrypted communication, the server typically uses port 443.
For unencrypted communication, the server typically uses port 80.

When a client wants to communicate with a server, it sends a request to the server's IP address on the appropriate port,
thus establishing a connection. The server processes the request and typically looks through a folder of files
known as the "web root" or "document root" to find the requested file. If the file is found, the server sends it back
to the client.The client then receives the file and displays it in a web browser or processes it as needed.

What is needed:
    Be able to read configuration files. The server will listen to requests on a port, we need to be able to build
    how those files will be written and read.

    Open a socket on a port and listen for requests. This will be the main loop of the server.

    Be able to parse requests. The server will need to understand the requests it receives from clients.

    Open and read files from web root directory. The server will need to access files to respond to client requests.

    Write responses back to the client. The server will need to send back the requested files or appropriate error messages.
